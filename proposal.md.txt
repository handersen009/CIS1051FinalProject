# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Veggie (bun)ny

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A shoot 'em up game but not as extreme and hard.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My idea is to make a shooting game using love. My software will let the user be able to control the character with what they input.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Rachel To, tul11813@temple.edu, Chong Li

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A playable game that has an ending
- User can fully control the character (move and shoot)
- Different stages (about 3-4)
- few different enemies and a boss

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Everything in the good outcome but with a complete storyline, and maybe more bosses

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
All of the above but with more
- unique characters each with their own stats
- longer more in depth story


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
The skills i will need to acquire is knowing how to code user input and make it actually happen on the screen. Rachel will have to research how to format images to the program and will work on making the images and sprites for the game and help with some of the coding. I will focus more on the code.
